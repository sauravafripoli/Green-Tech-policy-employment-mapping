Sector: GENDER, VULNERABLE GROUPS AND YOUTH

Action: Strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups* (women, orphans and vulnerable children, the elderly, and persons with disability).

Summary: 

Through a focus on Gender, Vulnerable Groups and Youth, the Government is committed to achieving gender equity in all aspects of society, provide children with basic rights, have a labour force inclusive of young people at all levels (15-35 year olds), alleviate the condition of vulnerable persons (including orphans and vulnerable children, persons with disabilities, the aged, widows, widowers, internally and externally displaced persons, marginalised persons and pastoralists living in ASALs) and enable the vulnerable to have equitable opportunities to participate in socio-economic activities. These groups are particularly vulnerable to a variable and changing climate and often have least access to and control of resources, (such as capital, credit, and land), live in areas exposed to a variable/changing climate (such as arid lands and urban poor areas) and are less able to cope with climate shocks and stresses. Climate-driven reductions in food accessibility are likely to lead to increased malnutrition with often irreversible consequences for young children.


Examples of ongoing projects/initiatives:

Hunger Safety Net Programme; Adaptation Consortium; Ending Drought Emergencies; National Drought and Disaster Contingency Fund; African Risk Capacity; Kenya Coastal Development Project; Integrated Programme to build resilience to climate change and adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities in Kenya; Arid Lands Support Programme; Rural livelihoods adaptation to climate change in the Horn of Africa Project; Adaptation Learning Programme for Africa; Women and Youth Enterprise Fund.

Gaps: Financing, capacity building, awareness raising.

Short-term sub actions:

•	Enhance access to the youth and women enterprise funds.
•	Strengthen and expand social protection and insurance mechanisms against main climate hazards.
•	Establish affordable and accessible credit lines for the urban and rural poor, youth and other vulnerable groups.
•	Create awareness for climate opportunities that women and youth can access.


Medium-term sub actions:

Promote livelihood diversification for vulnerable groups in order to reduce rural-urban migration.


Long-term sub actions:
Promote and support climate resilient sustainable livelihoods

Budget: US$ 274,646,553

Responsibility: Ministry(ies) responsible for gender, vulnerable groups and youth, MDAs,
County Governments, research institutions and academia, civil society
